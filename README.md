NostrChat is one of the most decentralized chat apps ever built. 

NostrChat is built on Nostr, and therefore doesn't rely on any centralized servers, just Nostr relays. Everyday users of NostrChat can immediately benefit from Nostr‚Äôs decentralized network. Power users can choose to further decentralization by running their own NostrChat client or Nostr relay. 

Our ReadMe is a summary about NostrChat, what it looks like, and how to use it.
